🚦 *The Problem:*  

- Daily commuters in Delhi NCR face high travel costs 💸, heavy traffic, and limited affordable ride options. 
- Many people travel similar routes 🛣 but lack a simple, safe way to connect and share rides, resulting in empty seats and wasted resources.

💡 *Our Solution — ShareWay:*  

  - A smart, community-powered platform where drivers offer empty seats and passengers easily find and book matching rides 🚗.
- If no driver is available, passengers are matched with each other to share a cab and split the fare, making travel more affordable and eco-friendly 👨🏻.

🚗 *How We Do It:*  

  - Users enter start and end locations using Google Maps-powered search for accurate matching.
  - Real-time algorithms pair riders and drivers (or riders with riders) based on route and timing.
- Secure profiles, transparent rating, and post-ride feedback build trust and safety in community.

*🌱 ShareWay :*
- Reducing Costs, building connections, saving environment.
